madison-code-and-coffee
=======================

A little repo to organize informal Madison morning coffee and hacking

I'd like to start a regular morning meet up of Madison hackers who either:

* work from home
* work from co-working spots
* work flexibly, as in they can work from outside their normal office

This will be a completely language agnostic meetup.  It will be informal to start, with no topics and no speakers.

We will use Issues in this repo to organize to start.
